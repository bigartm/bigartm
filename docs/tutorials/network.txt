Networking
==========

Other tutorials focus on how to use BigARTM
locally on your machine, within single process. Now we are
going to deploy BigARTM on several machines.

Network modus operandi
----------------------

First think you do to distribute CPU-intensive processing onto
several machines is to launch there a :class:`python_interface.NodeController` component.

One simple way to do so is to use ``node_controller`` application,
included in BigARTM distributive.

.. code-block:: bash

   >node_controller.exe

   Usage:
       ./node_controller <endpoint>

   Example:
       ./node_controller tcp://*:5555

   To connect to node_controller from master replace '*' with fully qualified DNS name of the host.

After NodeControler is launched, you may add its endpoint to
:attr:`MasterComponentConfig.node_connect_endpoint` list
and then use your :class:`python_interface.MasterComponent` as usual.
No further actions is required on the remote nodes.

.. warning::

   Some requirements and limitations apply in network mode.

   * :attr:`MasterComponentConfig.modus_operandi` must be set to ``Network``,
   * :attr:`MasterComponentConfig.disk_path` must be set to a network file share,
     accessible from all node controllers.
   * :attr:`MasterComponentConfig.cache_theta` does not work in Network mode.
