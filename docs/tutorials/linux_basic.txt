Basic BigARTM tutorial for Linux and Mac OS-X users
===================================================

Currently there is no distribution package of BigARTM for Linux.
BigARTM had been tested on several Linux OS, and it is known to work well,
but you have to get the source code and compile it locally on your machine.


Download sources and build
--------------------------

Clone the latest BigARTM code from our github repository,
and build it via CMake as in the following script.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get install git make cmake build-essential libboost-all-dev
   cd ~
   git clone --branch=stable https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm.git
   cd bigartm
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make


Running BigARTM from command line
---------------------------------

There is a simple utility ``bigartm``, which allows you to run BigARTM from command line.
To experiment with this tool you need a small dataset, which you can get via the following script.
More datasets are available through :doc:`/download` page.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/bigartm
   mkdir datasets && cd datasets
   wget https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/artm/docword.kos.txt.gz
   wget https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/artm/vocab.kos.txt
   gunzip docword.kos.txt.gz
   ../build/src/bigartm/bigartm -d docword.kos.txt -v vocab.kos.txt

Configure BigARTM Python API
----------------------------

For more advanced scenarios you need to configure Python interface for BigARTM.
To use BigARTM from Python you need to use Google Protobuf.
We recommend to use 'protobuf 2.5.1-pre', included in bigartm/3rdparty.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Step 1 - add BigARTM python bindings to PYTHONPATH
   export PYTHONPATH=~/bigartm/python:$PYTHONPATH

   # Step 2 - install google protobuf
   cd ~/bigartm
   cp build/3rdparty/protobuf-cmake/protoc/protoc 3rdparty/protobuf/src/
   cd 3rdparty/protobuf/python
   python setup.py build
   sudo python setup.py install

   # Step 3 - point ARTM_SHARED_LIBRARY variable to libartm.so (libartm.dylib) location
   export ARTM_SHARED_LIBRARY=~/bigartm/build/src/artm/libartm.so        # for linux
   export ARTM_SHARED_LIBRARY=~/bigartm/build/src/artm/libartm.dylib     # for Mac OS X

At this point you may run examples under ``~/bigartm/python/examples``.

Troubleshooting
---------------

.. code-block:: bash

  >python setup.py build
    File "setup.py", line 52
	  print "Generating %s..." % output

  SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to `print`

This error may happen during google protobuf installation.
It indicates that you are using ``Python 3``, which is not supported by BigARTM.
(see `this <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/826948/syntax-error-on-print-with-python-3>`_ 
question on StackOverflow for more details on the error around `print`).
Please use ``Python 2.7.9`` to workaround this issue.
 
.. code-block:: bash

   ubuntu@192.168.0.1:~/bigartm/python/examples$ python example01_synthetic_collection.py
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "example01_synthetic_collection.py", line 6, in <module>
       import artm.messages_pb2, artm.library, random, uuid
   ImportError: No module named artm.messages_pb2

This error indicate that python is unable to locate ``messages_pb2.py and ``library.py`` files.
Please verify if you executed ``Step #1`` in the instructions above.

.. code-block:: bash

   ubuntu@192.168.0.1:~/bigartm/python/examples$ python example01_synthetic_collection.py
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "example01_synthetic_collection.py", line 6, in <module>
       import artm.messages_pb2, artm.library, random, uuid
     File "/home/ubuntu/bigartm/python/messages_pb2.py", line 4, in <module>
       from google.protobuf import descriptor as _descriptor
   ImportError: No module named google.protobuf

This error indicated that python is unable to locate protobuf library.
Please verify if you executed ``Step #2`` in the instructions above.
If you do not have permissions to execute ``sudo python setup.py install`` step, you may also try to update PYTHONPATH manually:
``PYTHONPATH="/home/ubuntu/bigartm/3rdparty/protobuf/python:/home/ubuntu/bigartm/python:$PYTHONPATH"``.

.. code-block:: bash

   ubuntu@192.168.0.1:~/bigartm/python/examples$ python example01_synthetic_collection.py
   libartm.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory,
   fall back to ARTM_SHARED_LIBRARY environment variable
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "example01_synthetic_collection.py", line 27, in <module>
       with artm.library.MasterComponent() as master:
     File "/home/ubuntu/bigartm/python/artm/library.py", line 179, in __init__
       lib = Library().lib_
     File "/home/ubuntu/bigartm/python/artm/library.py", line 107, in __init__
       self.lib_ = ctypes.CDLL(os.environ['ARTM_SHARED_LIBRARY'])
     File "/usr/lib/python2.7/UserDict.py", line 23, in __getitem__
       raise KeyError(key)
   KeyError: 'ARTM_SHARED_LIBRARY'

This error indicate that BigARTM's python interface can not locate libartm.so (libartm.dylib) files.
Please verify if you executed ``Step #3`` correctly.

BigARTM on Travis-CI
--------------------

To get a live usage example of BigARTM you may check BigARTM's
`.travis.yml <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigartm/bigartm/master/.travis.yml>`_
script and the latest `continuous integration build
<https://travis-ci.org/bigartm/bigartm>`_.
