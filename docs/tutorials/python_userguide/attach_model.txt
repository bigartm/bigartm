7. Attach Model and Custom Phi Initialization
=============================================

Detailed description of all parameters and methods of BigARTM Python API classes can be found in :doc:`../../api_references/python_interface`.

Library supports an ability to access all :math:`\Phi`-like matrices directly from Python. This is a low-level functionality, so it wasn't included in the ``ARTM`` class, and can be used via low-level ``master_component`` interface. User can attach the matrix, e.g. get reference to it in the Python, and can change it's content between the iterations. The changes will be written in the native C++ memory.

The most evidence case of usage of this feature is a custom initialization of :math:`\Phi` matrix. The library initalizes it with random numbers by default. But there're several more complex and useful methods of initialization, that the library doesn't support yet. And in this case ``attach_model`` method can help you.

So let's attach to the :math:`\Phi` matrix of our model:

.. code-block:: python

   (_, phi_ref) = model.master.attach_model(model=model.model_pwt)

At this moment you can print :math:`\Phi` matrix to see it's content:

.. code-block:: python

   model.get_phi(model_name=model.model_pwt)

Next code can be used to check whether the attaching was successful:

.. code-block:: python

   for model_description in model.info.model:
        print model_description

The output will be similar to the following

.. code-block:: none



   name: "nwt"

   type: "class artm::core::DensePhiMatrix"

   num_topics: 50

   num_tokens: 2500



   name: "pwt"

   type: "class __artm::core::AttachedPhiMatrix__"

   num_topics: 50

   num_tokens: 2500



You can see, that the type of :math:`\Phi` matrix has changed from ``DensePhiMatrix`` to ``AttachedPhiMatrix``.

Now let's assume that you have created ``pwt_new`` matrix with the same size, filled with custom values. Let's write these values into our :math:`\Phi` matrix.

.. note::

   You need to write the values by accessing ``phi_ref`` variable, you are not allowed to assing it the whole ``pwt_new`` matrix, this operation will lead to an error in future work.

   .. code-block:: python

      numpy.copyto(phi_ref, new_phi.values)  # CORRECT!
        
      phi_ref = pwt_new  # NO!

After that you can print :math:`\Phi` matrix again and check the change of it's values. From this moment you can continue our work.
