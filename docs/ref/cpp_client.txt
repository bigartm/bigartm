BigARTM command line utility
============================

This document provides an overview of ``cpp_client``,
a simple command-line utility shipped with BigARTM.

To run *cpp_client* you need to download input data (a textual collection represented in bag-of-words format).
We recommend to download *vocab* and *docword* files by links provided in :doc:`/download` section of the tutorial.
Then you can use *cpp_client* as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   cpp_client -d docword.kos.txt -v vocab.kos.txt

You may append the following options to customize the resulting topic model:

  * ``-t`` or ``--num_topic`` sets the number of topics in the resulting topic model.
  * ``-i`` or ``--num_iters`` sets the number of iterative scans over the collection.
  * ``--num_inner_iters`` sets the number of updates of theta matrix performed on each iteration.
  * ``--reuse_theta`` enables caching of Theta matrix and re-uses last Theta matrix from
    the previous iteration as initial approximation on the next iteration. The default alternative
    without ``--reuse_theta`` switch is to generate random approximation of Theta matrix on each iteration.
  * ``--tau_phi``, ``--tau_theta`` and ``--tau_decor`` allows you to specify weights of different regularizers.
    Currently *cpp_client* does not allow you to customize regularizer weights for different topics
    and for different iterations. This limitation is only related to *cpp_client*,
    and you can simply achieve this by using BigARTM interface (either in Python or in C++).
  * ``--update_every`` is a parameter of the online algorithm.
    When specified, the model will be updated every *update_every* documents.

You may also apply the following optimizations that should not change the resulting model

  * ``-p`` allows you to specify number of concurrent processors.
    The recommended value is to use the number of logical cores on your machine.

  * ``--no_scores`` disables calculation and visualization of all scores.
    This is a clean way of measuring pure performance of BigARTM,
    because at the moment some scores takes unnecessary long time to calculate.

  * ``--disk_cache_folder`` applies only together with ``--reuse_theta``.
    This parameter allows you to specify a writable disk location where BigARTM can cache Theta matrix
    between iterations to avoid storing it in main memory.

  * ``--merger_queue_size`` limits the size of the merger queue. Decrease the size of the queue might
    reduce memory usage, but decrease CPU utilization of the processors.

.. code-block:: bash

    >cpp_client --help
    BigARTM - library for advanced topic modeling (http://bigartm.org):

    Basic options:
      -h [ --help ]                        display this help message
      -d [ --docword ] arg                 docword file in UCI format
      -v [ --vocab ] arg                   vocab file in UCI format
      -b [ --batch_folder ] arg            If docword or vocab arguments are not
                                           provided, cpp_client will try to read
                                           pre-parsed batches from batch_folder
                                           location. Otherwise, if both docword and
                                           vocab arguments are provided, cpp_client
                                           will parse data and store batches in
                                           batch_folder location.
      -t [ --num_topic ] arg (=16)         number of topics
      -p [ --num_processors ] arg (=2)     number of concurrent processors
      -i [ --num_iters ] arg (=10)         number of outer iterations

      --reuse_theta                        reuse theta between iterations
      --dictionary_file arg (=dictionary)  filename of dictionary file
      --items_per_batch arg (=500)         number of items per batch
      --tau_phi arg (=0)                   regularization coefficient for PHI

                                           decorrelation (use with care, since this
                                           value heavily depends on the size of the
                                           dataset)
      --paused                             wait for keystroke (allows to attach a
                                           debugger)
      --no_scores                          disable calculation of all scores
      --update_every arg (=0)              [online algorithm] requests an update of
                                           the model after update_every document
      --parsing_format arg (=0)            parsing format (0 - UCI, 1 - matrix
