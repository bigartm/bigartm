Windows distribution
====================

This chapter describes content of BigARTM distribution package for Windows, available at https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/releases.

=========================== =================================================================
``bin/``                    | Precompiled binaries of BigARTM for Windows.
                            | This folder must be added to ``PATH`` system variable.

``bin/artm.dll``            | Core functionality of the BigARTM library.

``bin/cpp_client.exe``      | Command line utility allows to perform simple experiments
                            | with BigARTM. Remember that not all BigARTM features are
                            | available through cpp_client, but it can serve as a good
                            | starting point to learn basic functionality. For further
                            | details refer to :doc:`/ref/cpp_client`.

``protobuf/``               | A minimalistic version of Google Protocol Buffers
                            | (https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/)
                            | library, required to run BigARTM from Python.
                            | To setup this package follow the instructions in
                            | ``protobuf/python/README`` file.

``python/artm/``            | Python programming interface to BigARTM library.
                            | This folder must be added to ``PYTHONPATH``
                            | system variable.

``library.py``              | Implements all classes of BigARTM python interface.

``messages_pb2.py``         | Contains all protobuf messages that can be transfered in
                            | and out BigARTM core library. Most common features are
                            | exposed  with their own API methods, so normally you
                            | do not use python protobuf messages to operate BigARTM.

``python/examples/``        | Python examples of how to use BigARTM:

                            | Files ``docword.kos.txt`` and ``vocab.kos.txt`` represent
                            | a simple collection of text files in Bag-Of-Words format.
                            | The files are taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository
                            | (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bag+of+Words).

``src/``                    | Several programming interfaces to BigARTM library.

``src/c_interface.h``       | :doc:`Low-level BigARTM interface </ref/c_interface>` in C.

``cpp_interface.h,cc``      | :doc:`C++ interface of BigARTM  </ref/cpp_interface>`
                              
``messages.pb.h,cc``        | Protobuf messages for C++ interface
                              
 ``messages.proto``         | Protobuf description for all messages that appear in the
                            | API of BigARTM. Documented :doc:`here </ref/messages>`.

``LICENSE``                 License file of BigARTM.
