C Interface
===========

This document explains all public methods of the low level BigARTM interface, written in plain C language.

Introduction
------------

The goal of low level API is to expose all functionality of the library
in a set of simple functions written in plain C language.
This makes it easier to consume BigARTM from various programming environments.
For example, the :doc:`python_interface` of BigARTM uses `ctypes <https://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html>`_
module to call the low level BigARTM interface.
Most programming environments also have similar functionality:
`PInvoke <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa288468(v=vs.71).aspx>`_ in C#,
`loadlibrary <http://www.mathworks.se/help/matlab/matlab_external/calling-functions-in-shared-libraries.html>`_ in Matlab,
etc.

Typical methods of low-level API may look as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   int ArtmCreateMasterModel(int length, const char* master_model_config);
   int ArtmFitOfflineMasterModel(int master_id, int length, const char* fit_offline_master_model_args);
   int ArtmRequestTopicModel(int master_id, int length, const char* get_model_args);
 
This methods, similarly to most other methods in low level API,
accept a serialized binary representation of some Google Protocol Buffer message.
From BigARTM v0.8.2 it is also possible to pass JSON-serialized protobuf message.
This might be useful if you are planing to use low-level C interface from environment where
configuring protobuf libraries would be challenging.
Please, refer to :doc:`../devguide/messages` for more details about each particular message,
and `Protobuf documentation <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json>`_ regarding JSON mapping.

Note that this documentation is incomplete.
For the actual list the methods of low-level C API please refer to
`c_interface.h <https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/blob/master/src/artm/c_interface.h>`_.
Same is true about messages documentation.
It is always recommended to review the
`messages.proto <https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/blob/master/src/artm/messages.proto>`_ definition.

If you plan to implement a high-wrapper around low-level API we recoomend to review
the source code of existing wrappers
`cpp_interface.h <https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/blob/master/src/artm/cpp_interface.h>`_,
`cpp_interface.cc <https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/blob/master/src/artm/cpp_interface.cc>`_ (for C++ wrapper)
and `spec.py <https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/blob/master/python/artm/wrapper/spec.py>`_,
`api.py <https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/blob/master/python/artm/wrapper/api.py>`_ (for python wrapper).

  int                       = ArtmProtobufMessageFormatIsJson();

Below we give a short description of these methods.

  * ``ArtmConfigureLogging`` allows to configure logging parameters; this method is optional, you may not use it
  * ``ArtmGetVersion`` returns the version of BigARTM library
  * ``ArtmParseCollection`` parse collection in VW or UCI-BOW formats, creates batches and stores them to disk
  * ``ArtmCreateMasterModel`` / ``ArtmReconfigureMasterModel`` / ``ArtmDisposeMasterComponent``
    create master model / updates its parameters / dispose given instance of master model.
  * ``ArtmImportBatches`` loads batches from disk into memory for quicker processing.
    This is optional, most methods that require batches can work directly with files on disk.
  * ``ArtmGatherDictionary`` / ``ArtmFilterDictionary`` / ``ArtmImportDictionary`` / ``ArtmExportDictionary``
    Main methods to work with dictionaries. *Gather* initialized the dictionary based on a folder with batches,
    *Filter* eliminates tokens based on their frequency, *Import*/*Export* save and re-load dictionary to/from disk.
  * You may also created the dictionary from ``artm.DictionaryData`` message, that contains the list of all tokens to be included in the dictionary.
    To do this use method ``ArtmCreateDictionary`` (to create a dictionary) and ``ArtmRequestDictionary``
    (to retrieve ``artm.DictionaryData`` for an existing dictionary). 
  * ``ArtmInitializeModel`` / ``ArtmExportModel`` / ``ArtmImportModel`` handle *models*
    (e.g. matrices of size ``|T|*|W|`` such as *pwt*, *nwt* or *rwt*).
    *Initialize** fills the matrix with random ``0..1`` values.
    *Export* and *Import* saves the matrix to disk and re-loads it back.
  * ``ArtmOverwriteTopicModel`` allows to overwite values in topic model
    (for example to manually specify initial approximation).
  * ``ArtmFitOfflineMasterModel`` --- fit the model with *offline* algorithm
  * ``ArtmFitOnlineMasterModel`` --- fit the model with *online* algorithm
  * ``ArtmRequestTransformMasterModel`` --- apply the model to new data
  * ``ArtmRequestMasterModelConfig`` --- retrieve configuration of master model
  * ``ArtmRequestThetaMatrix`` --- retrieve cached theta matrix
  * ``ArtmRequestTopicModel`` --- retrieve a model (e.g. pwt, nwt or rwt matrix)
  * ``ArtmRequestScore`` -- retrieve score (such as perplexity, sparsity, etc)
  * ``ArtmRequestScoreArray`` -- retrieve historical information for a given score
  * ``ArtmRequestMasterComponentInfo`` -- retrieve diagnostics information and internal state of the master model
  * ``ArtmDisposeModel`` / ``ArtmDisposeDictionary`` / ``ArtmDisposeBatch`` -- dispose specific objects
  * ``ArtmClearThetaCache`` / ``ArtmClearScoreCache`` / ``ArtmClearScoreArrayCache`` -- clear specific caches
  * ``ArtmSetProtobufMessageFormatToJson`` / ``ArtmSetProtobufMessageFormatToBinary`` /
    ``ArtmProtobufMessageFormatIsJson`` -- configure the low-level API to work with
    JSON-serialized protobuf messages instead of binary-serialized protobuf messages

The following operations are less important part of low-level BigARTM CLI.
In most cases you won'e need them, unless you have a very specific needs.

.. code-block:: bash

  master_id                 = ArtmDuplicateMasterComponent     (master_id, artm.DuplicateMasterComponentArgs);
                              ArtmCreateRegularizer            (master_id, artm.RegularizerConfig);
                              ArtmReconfigureRegularizer       (master_id, artm.RegularizerConfig);
                              ArtmDisposeRegularizer           (master_id, const char* regularizer_name);
                              ArtmOverwriteTopicModelNamed     (master_id, artm.TopicModel, const char* name);
                              ArtmCreateDictionaryNamed        (master_id, artm.DictionaryData, const char* name);
                              ArtmAttachModel                  (master_id, artm.AttachModelArgs, int address_length, char* address);
  artm.ProcessBatchesResult = ArtmRequestProcessBatches        (master_id, artm.ProcessBatchesArgs);
  artm.ProcessBatchesResult = ArtmRequestProcessBatchesExternal(master_id, artm.ProcessBatchesArgs);
                              ArtmAsyncProcessBatches          (master_id, artm.ProcessBatchesArgs);
                              ArtmMergeModel                   (master_id, artm.MergeModelArgs);
                              ArtmRegularizeModel              (master_id, artm.RegularizeModelArgs);
                              ArtmNormalizeModel               (master_id, artm.NormalizeModelArgs);
  artm.Batch                = ArtmRequestLoadBatch             (           const char* filename);
                              ArtmAwaitOperation               (           int operation_id, artm.AwaitOperationArgs);
                              ArtmSaveBatch                    (           const char* disk_path, artm.Batch);


Protocol for retrieving results
-------------------------------

The methods in low-level API can be split into two groups ---
those that *execute* certain action, and those that *request* certain data.
For example ``ArtmCreateMasterModel`` and ``ArtmFitOfflineMasterModel``
just execute an action, while ``ArtmRequestTopicModel`` is a request for data.
Naming convention is that such requests always start with ``ArtmRequest`` prefix.

1. To call execute-action method is fairly straighforward ---
first you create a protobuf message that describe the arguments of the operation.
For example, ``ArtmCreateMasterModel`` expects ``artm.MasterModelConfig`` message,
as defined in the documentation of ``ArtmCreateMasterModel``. 
Then you serialize protobuf message,
and pass it to the method along with the length of the serialized message.
In some cases you also pass the *master_id*, returned by ``ArtmCreateMasterModel``,
as described in details futher below on this page.
The execute-action method will typically return an error code,
with zero value (or ``ARTM_SUCCESS``) indicating successfull execution. 

2. To call request-data method is more tricky.
First you follow the same procedure as when calling an execute-action method,
e.g. create and serialize protobuf message and pass it to your ``ArtmRequestXxx`` operation.
For example, ``ArtmRequestTopicModel`` expects ``artm.GetTopicModelArgs`` message. 
Then the method like ``ArtmRequestTopicModel`` will return the size (in bytes)
of the memory buffer that needs to be allocated by caller.
To fill this buffer with actual data you need to call method

.. code-block:: bash

   int ArtmCopyRequestedMessage(int length, char* address)

where ``address`` give a pointer to the memory buffer,
and ``length`` must give the length of the buffer
(e.g. must match the value returned by ``ArtmRequestXxx`` call).
After ``ArtmCopyRequestedMessage`` the buffer will contain protobuf-serialized message.
To deserialize this message you need to know its protobuf type,
which will be defined by the documentation of the ``ArtmRequestXxx`` method that you are calling.
For ``ArtmRequestTopicModel`` it will be a ``artm.TopicModel`` message.

3. Note that few ``ArtmRequestXxx`` methods has a more complex protocol that require two subsequent calls ---
first, to ``ArtmCopyRequestedMessage``, and then to ``ArtmCopyRequestedObject``.
If that's the case the name of the method will be ``ArtmRequestXxxExternal``
(for example ``ArtmRequestThetaMatrixExternal`` or ``ArtmRequestTopicModelExternal``).
Typically this is used to copy out large objects, such as theta or phi matrices,
and store them directly as dense matrices, bypassing protobuf serialization.
For more information see
`cpp_interface.cc <https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/blob/master/src/artm/cpp_interface.cc>`_.

A side-note on thread safety:
in between calls to ``ArtmRequestXxx`` and ``ArtmCopyRequestedMessage``
the result is stored in a thread local storage.
This allows you to call multiple ``ArtmRequestXxx`` methods from different threads.


Error handling
--------------

All methods in this API return an integer value.
Negative return values represent an error code.
See :ref:`error codes <error-codes>` for the list of all error codes.
To get corresponding error message as string use :c:func:`ArtmGetLastErrorMessage`.
Non-negative return values represent a success, and for some API methods
might also incorporate some useful information.
For example, :c:func:`ArtmCreateMasterModel` returns the ID of newly created master component,
and :c:func:`ArtmRequestTopicModel` returns the length of the buffer that should be allocated before
calling :c:func:`ArtmCopyRequestedMessage`.


MasterId and MasterModel
------------------------

The concept of *Master Model* is central in low-level API.
Almost any interaction with the low-level API starts by calling 
method ``ArtmCreateMasterModel``, which creates an instance of so-called *Master Model* (or *Master Component*),
and returns its ``master_id`` -- an integer identifier that refers to that instance.
You need ``master_id`` in the remaining methods of the low-level API,
such as ``ArtmFitOfflineMasterModel``.
``master_id`` creates a context, or scope, that isolate different models from each other.
An operation applied to a specific ``master_id`` will not affect other master components.
Each master model occupy some memory --- potentially a very large amount,
depending on the number of topics and tokens in the model.
Once you are done with a specific instance of master component you need to dispose its resources
by calling ``ArtmDisposeMasterComponent(master_id)``.
After that ``master_id`` is no longer valid, and it must not be used as argument to other methods.

You may use method ``ArtmRequestMasterComponentInfo`` to retrieve
internal diagnostics information about master component.
It will reveal its internal state and tell the config of the master component,
the list of scores and regularizers, the list of phi matrices,
the list of dictionaries, cache entries, and other informatino
that will help to understand how master component is functioning.

Note there might be confusion between terms *MasterComponent* and *MasterModel*,
throughout this page as well as in the actual naming of the methods.
This is due to historical reasons,
and for all practical purposes you may think that this terms refer to the same thing.

ArtmConfigureLogging
--------------------

You may use ``ArtmConfigureLogging`` call to set logging parameters,
such as verbosity level or directory to output logs.
You are not require to call ``ArtmConfigureLogging``,
in which case logging is automaticaly initialized to INFO level,
and logs are placed in the active working folder.

Note that you can set log directory just one time.
Once it is set you can not change it afterwards.
Method ``ArtmConfigureLogging`` will return error code ``INVALID_OPERATION``
if it detects an attempt to change logging folder after logging had been initialized.
In order to set log directory the call to ``ArtmConfigureLogging``
must happen prior to calling any other methods in low-level C API.
(with exception to ``ArtmSetProtobufMessageFormatToJson``,
``ArtmSetProtobufMessageFormatToBinary`` and ``ArtmProtobufMessageFormatIsJson``).
This is because methods in ``c_interface`` may automatically initialize logging
into current working directory, which later can not be changed.

Setting log directory require that target folder already exist on disk.

The following parameters can be customized with ``ArtmConfigureLogging``.

.. code-block:: bash

    message ConfigureLoggingArgs {
      // If specified, logfiles are written into this directory
      // instead of the default logging directory.
      optional string log_dir = 1;

      // Messages logged at a lower level than this
      // do not actually get logged anywhere
      optional int32 minloglevel = 2;

      // Log messages at a level >= this flag are automatically
      // sent to stderr in addition to log files.
      optional int32 stderrthreshold = 3;

      // Log messages go to stderr instead of logfiles
      optional bool logtostderr = 4;

      // color messages logged to stderr (if supported by terminal)
      optional bool colorlogtostderr = 5;

      // log messages go to stderr in addition to logfiles
      optional bool alsologtostderr = 6;

      // Buffer log messages for at most this many seconds
      optional int32 logbufsecs = 7;

      // Buffer log messages logged at this level or lower
      // (-1 means do not buffer; 0 means buffer INFO only; ...)
      optional int32 logbuflevel = 8;

      // approx. maximum log file size (in MB). A value of 0 will be silently overridden to 1.
      optional int32 max_log_size = 9;

      // Stop attempting to log to disk if the disk is full.
      optional bool stop_logging_if_full_disk = 10;
    }

We recommend to set ``logbuflevel = -1`` to not buffer log messages.
However by default BigARTM does not set this parameter, using the same default as provided by glog.

ArtmReconfigureTopicName
------------------------

To explain ``ArtmReconfigureTopicName`` we need to first start with ``ArtmReconfigureMasterModel``.
``ArtmReconfigureMasterModel`` allow user to rename topics, but the number of topics must stay the same,
and the order and the content of all existing phi matrices remains unchanged.
On contrary, ``ArtmReconfigureTopicName`` may change the number of topics by adding or removing topics,
as well as reorder columns of existing phi matrices.
In ``ArtmReconfigureMasterModel`` the list of topic names is treated
as new identifiers that should be set for existing columns.
In ``ArtmReconfigureTopicName`` the list of topic names is matched against previous topic names.
New topic names are added to phi matrices, topic names removed from the list are excluded from phi matrices,
and topic names present in both old and new lists are re-ordered accordingly to match new topic name list.

Examples for ``ArtmReconfigureMasterModel``:

* ``t1, t2, t3`` -> ``t4, t5, t6`` sets new topic names for existing columns in phi matrices.

Examples for ``ArtmReconfigureTopicName``:

* ``t1, t2, t3`` -> ``t1, t2, t3, t4`` adds a new column to phi matrices, initialized with zeros
* ``t1, t2, t3`` -> ``t1, t2`` removes last column from phi matrices
* ``t1, t2, t3`` -> ``t2, t3`` removes the first column from phi matrices
* ``t1, t2, t3`` -> ``t3, t2`` removes the first column from phi matrices and swaps the remaining two columns
* ``t1, t2, t3`` -> ``t4, t5, t6`` removes all columns from phi matrices and creates three new columns, initialized with zeros

Note that both ``ArtmReconfigureTopicName`` and ``ArtmReconfigureMasterModel`` only affect phi matrices
where set of topic names match the configuration of the master model.
User-created matrices with custom set of topic names,
for example created via ``ArtmMergeModel``, will stay unchanged.

If you change topic names you should also consider changing your configuration of scores and regularizers.
Also take into account that ``ArtmReconfigureTopicName`` and ``ArtmReconfigureMasterModel`` do not update theta cache.
It is a good idea to call ``ArtmClearThetaCache`` after changing topic names.


ArtmGetLastErrorMessage
-----------------------

.. c:function::  const char* ArtmGetLastErrorMessage()

   Retrieves the textual error message, occured during the last failing request.
