Changes in Protobuf Messages
============================

v0.8.2
------

* added ``CollectionParserConfig.num_threads`` to control the number of threads that perform parsing.
  At the moment the feature is only implemented for VW-format.
* added ``CollectionParserConfig.class_id`` (repeated string) to control which modalities should be parsed.
  If token's class_id is not from this list, it will be excluded from the resulting batches.
  When the list is empty, all modalities are included (this is the default behavior, as before).
* added ``CollectionParserInfo`` message to export diagnostics information from ``ArtmParseCollection``
* added ``FilterDictionaryArgs.max_dictionary_size`` to give user an easy option to limit his dictionary size
* added ``MergeModelArgs.dictionary_name`` to define the set of tokens in the resulting matrix
* added ``ThetaMatrix.num_values``, ``TopicModel.num_values`` to define number of non-zero elements in sparse format

v0.8.0
------

.. warning::

  New batches, created in `BigARTM v0.8`, **CAN NOT** be used in the previous versions of the library.
  Old batches, created prior to `BigARTM v0.8`, can still be used. See below for details.

* added ``token_id`` and ``token_weight`` field in ``Item`` message, and obsoleted ``Item.field``.
  Internally the library will merge the content of ``Field.token_id`` and ``Field.token_weight``
  across all fields,
  and store the result back into ``Item.token_id``, ``Item.token_weight``.
  New ``Item`` message is as follows:

  .. code-block:: bash

    message Item {
      optional int32 id = 1;
      repeated Field field = 2;  // obsolete in BigARTM v0.8.0
      optional string title = 3;
      repeated int32 token_id = 4;
      repeated float token_weight = 5;
    }
* renamed ``topics_count`` into ``num_topics`` across multiple messsages (``TopicModel``, ``ThetaMatrix``, etc)
* renamed ``inner_iterations_count`` into ``num_document_passes`` in ``ProcessBatchesArgs``
* renamed ``passes`` into ``num_collection_passes`` in ``FitOfflineMasterModelArgs``
* renamed ``threads`` into ``num_processors`` in ``MasterModelConfig``
* renamed ``topic_index`` field into ``topic_indices`` in ``TopicModel`` and ``ThetaMatrix`` messages
* added messages ``ScoreArray``, ``GetScoreArrayArgs`` and ``ClearScoreArrayCacheArgs`` to bring score tracking functionality down into BigARTM core
* added messages ``BackgroundTokensRatioConfig`` and ``BackgroundTokensRatio`` (new score)
* moved ``model_name`` from ``GetScoreValueArgs`` into ``ScoreConfig``;
  this is done to support score tracking functionality in BigARTM core;
  each Phi score needs to know which model to use in calculation
* removed ``topics_count`` from ``InitializeModelArgs``; users must specify topic names in ``InitializeModelArgs.topic_name`` field
* removed ``topic_index`` from ``GetThetaMatrixArgs``; users must specify topic names to retrieve in ``GetThetaMatrixArgs.topic_name``
* removed ``batch`` field in ``GetThetaMatrixArgs`` and ``GetScoreValueArgs.batch`` messages;
  users should use ``ArtmRequestTransformMasterModel`` or ``ArtmRequestProcessBatches`` to process new batches and calculate theta scores
* removed ``reset_scores`` flag in ``ProcessBatchesArgs``; users should use new API ``ArtmClearScoreCache``
* removed ``clean_cache`` flag in ``GetThetaMatrixArgs``; users should use new API ``ArtmClearThetaCache``
* removed ``MasterComponentConfig``; users should user ``ArtmCreateMasterModel`` and pass ``MasterModelConfig`` 
* removed obsolete fields in ``CollectionParserConfig``; same arguments can be specified at ``GatherDictionaryArgs`` and passed to ``ArtmGatherDictionary``
* removed ``Filter`` message in ``InitializeModelArgs``; same arguments can be specified at ``FilterDictionaryArgs`` and passed to ``ArtmFilterDictionary``
* removed ``batch_name`` from ``ImportBatchesArgs``; the field is no longer needed; batches will be identified via their ``Batch.id`` identifier
* removed ``use_v06_api`` in ``MasterModelConfig``
* removed ``ModelConfig`` message
* removed ``SynchronizeModelArgs``, ``AddBatchArgs``, ``InvokeIterationArgs``, ``WaitIdleArgs`` messages; users should use new APIs based on MasterModel
* removed ``GetRegularizerStateArgs``, ``RegularizerInternalState``, ``MultiLanguagePhiInternalState`` messages
* removed ``model_name`` and ``model_name_cache`` in ``ThetaMatrix``, ``GetThetaMatrixArgs`` and ``ProcessBatchesArgs``;
  the code of master component is simplified to only handle one theta matrix, so there is no longer any reason to identify theta matrix with ``model_name``
* removed ``Stream`` message, ``MasterComponentConfig.stream`` field, and all ``stream_name`` fields across several messages;
  train/test streaming functionality is fully removed; users are expected to manage their train and test collections (for example as separate folders with batches)
* removed ``use_sparse_bow`` field in several messages; the computation mode with dense matrices is no longer supported;
* renamed ``item_count`` into ``num_items`` in ``ThetaSnippetScoreConfig``
* add global enum ``ScoreType`` as a replacement for enums ``Type`` from ``ScoreConfig`` and ``ScoreData`` messages
* add global enum ``RegularizerType`` as a replacement for enum ``Type`` from ``RegularizerConfig`` message
* add global enum ``MatrixLayout`` as a replacement for enum ``MatrixLayout`` from ``GetThetaMatrixArgs`` and ``GetTopicModelArgs`` messages
* add global enum ``ThetaMatrixType`` as a replacement for enum ``ThetaMatrixType`` from ``ProcessBatchesArgs`` and ``TransformMasterModelArgs`` messages
* renamed enum ``Type`` into ``SmoothType`` in ``SmoothPtdwConfig`` to avoid conflicts in C# messages
* renamed enum ``Mode`` into ``SparseMode`` in ``SpecifiedSparsePhiConfig`` to avoid conflicts in C# messages
* renamed enum ``Format`` into ``CollectionFormat`` in ``CollectionParserConfig`` to avoid conflicts in C# messages
* renamed enum ``NameType`` into ``BatchNameType`` in ``CollectionParserConfig`` to avoid conflicts in C# messages
* renamed field ``transform_type`` into ``type`` in ``TransformConfig`` to avoid conflicts in C# messages
* remove message ``CopyRequestResultArgs``;
  this is a breaking change; please check that

  * all previous calls to ``ArtmCopyRequestResult`` are changed to to ``ArtmCopyRequestedMessage``
  * all previous calls to ``ArtmCopyRequestResultEx`` with request types ``GetThetaSecondPass`` and ``GetModelSecondPass`` are changed to ``ArtmCopyRequestedObject``
  * all previous calls to ``ArtmCopyRequestResultEx`` with ``DefaultRequestType`` are changed to ``ArtmCopyRequestedMessage``

* remove field ``request_type`` in ``GetTopicModelArgs``;
  to request only topics and/or tokens users should set ``GetTopicModelArgs.matrix_layout`` to ``MatrixLayout_Sparse``,
  and ``GetTopicModelArgs.eps = 1.001`` (any number greather that 1.0).
* change ``optional FloatArray`` into ``repeated float`` in field ``coherence`` of ``TopTokensScore``
* change ``optional DoubleArray`` into ``repeated double`` in fields ``kernel_size``, ``kernel_purity``, ``kernel_contrast`` and ``coherence`` of ``TopicKernelScore``
* change ``optional StringArray`` into ``repeated string`` in field ``topic_name`` of ``TopicKernelScore``
