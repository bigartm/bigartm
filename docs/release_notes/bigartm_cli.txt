Changes in BigARTM CLI
======================

v0.9.0
------

* added option ``--cooc-window`` to set width of window in which tokens are considered to occurr together.
* added option ``--cooc-min-tf`` to set minimal value of absolute co-occurrence of tokens.
* added option ``--cooc-min-df`` to set minimal value of documental frequency of token co-occurrerence.
* added option ``--write-cooc-tf`` to set path of output file with absolute co-occurrences.
* added option ``--write-cooc-df`` to set path of output file with documental frequency of token co-occurrences.
* added option ``--write-ppmi-tf`` to set path of output file with ppmi's calculated on base of absolute co-occurrences.
* added option ``--write-ppmi-df`` to set path of output file with ppmi's calculated on base of documental frequences of token co-occurrences.

v0.8.2
------

* added option ``--rand-seed`` to initialize random number generator; without this options, RNG will be set using system time
* added option ``--write-vw-corpus`` to convert batches into plain text file in Vowpal Wabbit format
* change the naming scheme of the batches, saved with ``--save-batches`` option.
  Previously file names were guid-based, while new format will look like this: ``aabcde.batch``.
  New format ensures the ordering of the documents in the collection is be preserved, given that user scans batches alphabetically.
* added switch ``--guid-batch-name`` to enable old naming scheme of batches (guid-based names).
  This option is useful if you launch multiple instances of BigARTM CLI to concurrently generate batches.
* speedup parsing large files in VowpalWabbit format
* when ``--use-modality`` is specified, the batches saved with ``--save-batches`` will only include tokens from these modalities.
  Other tokens will be ignored during parsing. This option is implemented for both VW and UCI BOW formats.
* implement ``TopicSelection``, ``LabelRegularization``, ``ImproveCoherence``, ``Biterms`` regularizer in BigARTM CLI
* added option ``--dictionary-size`` to give user an easy option to limit his dictionary size
* add more diagnostics information about dictionary size (before and after filtering)
* add strict verification of scores and regularizers; for example, BigARTM CLI will raise an exception for this input:
  ``bigartm -t obj:10,back:5 --regularizer "0.5 SparsePhi #obj*"``. There shouldn't be star sign in ``#obj*``.

v0.8.0
------

* renamed ``--passes`` into ``--num-collection-passes``
* renamed ``--num-inner-iterations`` into ``--num-document-passes``
* removed ``--model-v06`` option
* removed ``--use-dense-bow`` option

v0.7.x
------
