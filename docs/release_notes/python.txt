Changes in Python API
=====================

This page describes recent changes in BigARTM's Python API.
Note that the API might be affected by changes in the underlying protobuf messages.
For this reason we recommend to review :doc:`messages`.

For further reference about Python API refer to :doc:`/api_references/python_interface/artm_model`,
`Q & A <https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/wiki/Q&A>`_ or `tutorials <https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm-book/blob/master/README.md>`_.

v0.9.0
------
* Remove flag ``process_in_memory`` from ``artm.BatchVectorizer``, and rename ``model`` parameter into ``process_in_memory_model``. Passing this parameter with ``data_format='batches'`` will trigger in-memory processing of batches specified in ``batches`` parameter.
* ``artm.BatchVectorizer`` now can receive sparse matrices (subclasses of ``scipy.sparse.spmatrix``) for in-memory batch processing.
* Enable custom decorrelation by specifying separate decorrelation coefficients for every pair of topics into ``artm.DecorrelatorPhiRegularizer`` via optional parameter ``topic_pairs``.
* Add new regularizers: ``artm.SmoothTimeInTopicsPhiRegularizer`` and ``artm.NetPlsaRegularizer``.
* Add support for entire model saving and loading via ``dump_artm_model`` and ``load_artm_model`` methods of ``artm.ARTM``.


v0.8.3
------

* Enable copying of ARTM, LDA, hARTM and ARTM_Level objects with ``clone()`` method and ``copy.deepcopy(obj)``.
* Experimental support for import/export/editing of theta matrices; for more details see python reference of ``ARTM.__init__(ptd_name='ptd')``.
* ``ARTM.get_phi_dense()`` method to extract phi matrix without pandas.DataFrame, see `#758 <https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/issues/758>`_.
* Bug fix in ``ARTM.get_phi_sparse()`` to return tokens as rows, and topic names as columns (previously it was the opposite way)


v0.8.2
------

.. warning::

   BigARTM 3rdparty dependency had been upgraded from ``protobuf 2.6.1`` to ``protobuf 3.0.0``.
   This may affect you upgrade from previous version of bigartm.
   Pelase report any issues at `bigartm-users@googlegroups.com <https://groups.google.com/group/bigartm-users>`_.

.. warning::

   BigARTM now require you to install `tqdm <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm>`_ library to visualize progress bars.
   To install use ``pip install tqdm`` or ``conda install -c conda-forge tqdm``.


* Add support for python 3.0
* Add hARTM class to support hierarchy model
* Add HierarchySparsingTheta for advanced inference of hierarchical models
* Enable replacing regularizers in ARTM-like models:

  .. code-block:: python

    # using operator[]-like style
    model.regularizers['somename'] = SomeRegularizer(...)
    # using keyword argument overwrite in add function
    model.regularizers.add(SomeRegularizer(name='somename', ...), overwrite=True)

* Better error reporting: raise exception in fit_offline, fit_online and transform if there is no data to process)
* Better support for changes in topic names, with reconfigure(), initialize() and merge_model()
* Show progress bars in ``fit_offline``, ``fit_online`` and ``transform``.
* Add ``ARTM.reshape_topics`` method to add/remove/reorder topics.
* Add ``max_dictionary_size`` parameter to ``Dictionary.filter()``
* Add ``class_ids`` parameter to ``BatchVectorizer.__init__()``
* Add ``dictionary_name`` parameter to ``MasterComponent.merge_model()``
* Add ``ARTM.transform_sparse()`` and ``ARTM.get_theta_sparse()`` for sparse retrieval of theta matrix
* Add ``ARTM.get_phi_sparse()`` for sparse retrieval of phi matrix

v0.8.1
------

* New source type 'bow_n_wd' was added into BatchVectorizer class. This type oriented on using the output of CountVectorizer and TfIdfVectorizers classes from sklearn.
  New parameters of BatchVectorizer are: n_wd (numpy.array) and vocabulary(dict)
* LDA model was added as one of the public interfaces. It is a restricted ARTM model created to simplify BigARTM usage for new users with few experience in topic modeling.
* BatchVectorizer got a flag 'gather_dictionary', which has default value 'True'. This means that BV would create dictionary and save it in the BV.dictionary field.
  For 'bow_n_wd' format the dictionary will be gathered whenever the flag was set to 'False' or to 'True'.
* Add relative regularization for Phi matrix

v0.8.0
------

.. warning::

   Note that your script can be affected by our changes in the default values for ``num_document_passes`` and ``reuse_theta`` parameters (see below).
   We recommend to use our new default settings, ``num_document_passes = 10`` and ``reuse_theta = False``.
   However, if you choose to explicitly set ``num_document_passes = 1`` then make sure to also set ``reuse_theta = True``,
   otherwise you will experience very slow convergence.


* all operations to work with dictionaries were moved into a separate class ``artm.Dictionary``.
  (details in `the documentation <http://docs.bigartm.org/en/master/python_interface/dictionary.html>`_).
  The mapping between old and new methods is very straighforward:
  ``ARTM.gather_dictionary`` is replaced with ``Dictionary.gather`` method, which allows to gather a dictionary from a set of batches;
  ``ARTM.filter_dictionary`` is replaced with ``Dictionary.filter`` method, which allows to filter a dictionary based on term frequency and document frequency;
  ``ARTM.load_dictionary`` is replaced with ``Dictionary.load`` method, which allows to load a dictionary previously exported to disk in ``Dictionary.save`` method;
  ``ARTM.create_dictionary`` is replaced with ``Dictionary.create`` method, which allows to create a dictionary based on custom protobuf message ``DictionaryData``, containing a set of dictionary entries;
  etc... The following code snippet gives a basic example:
  
  .. code-block:: bash

    my_dictionary = artm.Dictionary()
    my_dictionary.gather(data_path='my_collection_batches', vocab_file_path='vocab.txt')
    my_dictionary.save(dictionary_path='my_collection_batches/my_dictionary')
    my_dictionary.load(dictionary_path='my_collection_batches/my_dictionary.dict')
    model = artm.ARTM(num_topics=20, dictionary=my_dictionary)
    model.scores.add(artm.PerplexityScore(name='my_fisrt_perplexity_score',
                                          use_unigram_document_model=False,
                                          dictionary=my_dictionary))
  
* added ``library_version`` property to ``ARTM`` class to query for the version of the underlying BigARTM library; returns a string in MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format;
* ``dictionary_name`` argument had been renamed to ``dictionary`` in many places across python interface, including scores and regularizers.
  This is done because those arguments can now except not just a string, but also the ``artm.Dictionary`` class itself.
* with ``Dictionary`` class users no longer have to generate names for their dictionaries (e.g. the unique ``dictionary_name`` identifier that references the dictionary).
  You may use ``Dictionary.name`` field to access to the underlying name of the dictionary.
* added ``dictionary`` argument to ``ARTM.__init__`` constructor to let user initialize the model;
  note that we've change the behavior that model is automatically initialized whenever user calls ``fit_offline`` or ``fit_online``.
  Now this is no longer the case, and we expect user to either pass a dictionary in ``ARTM.__init__`` constructor, or manually call ``ARTM.initialize`` method.
  If neither is performed then ``ARTM.fit_offline`` and ``ARTM.fit_online`` will throw an exception.
* added ``seed`` argument to ``ARTM.__init__`` constructor to let user randomly initialize the model;
* added new score and score tracker ``BackgroundTokensRatio`` 
* remove the default value from ``num_topics`` argument in ``ARTM.__init__`` constructor, which previously was defaulting to ``num_topics = 10``;
  now user must always specify the desired number of topics;
* moved argument ``reuse_theta`` from ``fit_offline`` method into ``ARTM.__init__`` constructor;
  the argument is still used to indicate that the previous theta matrix should be re-used on the next pass over the collection;
  setting ``reuse_theta = True`` in the constructor will now be applied to ``fit_online``, which previously did not have this option.
* moved common argument ``num_document_passes`` from ``ARTM.fit_offline``, ``ARTM.fit_online``, ``ARTM.transform`` methods into ``ARTM.__init__`` constructor.
* changed the default value of ``cache_theta`` parameter from ``True`` to ``False`` (in ``ARTM.__init__`` constructor);
  this is done to avoid excessive memory usage due to caching of the entire Theta matrix;
  if caching is indeed required user has to manually turn it on by setting ``cache_theta = True``.
* changed the default value of ``reuse_theta`` parameter from ``True`` to ``False`` (in ``ARTM.__init__`` constructor);
  the reason is the same as for changing the default for ``cache_theta`` parameter
* changed the default value of ``num_document_passes`` parameter from ``1`` to ``10`` (in ``ARTM.__init__`` constructor);
* added arguments ``apply_weight``, ``decay_weight`` and ``update_after`` in ``ARTM.fit_online`` method;
  each argument accepts a list of floats;
  setting all three arguments will override the default behavior of the online algorithm
  that rely on a specific formula with ``tau0``, ``kappa`` and ``update_every``.
* added argument ``async`` (boolean flag) in ``ARTM.fit_online`` method for improved performance.
* added argument ``theta_matrix_type`` in ``ARTM.transform`` method;
  potential values are: ``"dense_theta"``, ``"dense_ptdw"``, ``None``; default matrix type is ``"dense_theta"``.
* introduced a separate method ``ARTM.remove_theta`` to clear cached theta matrix; remove corresponding boolean switch ``remove_theta`` from ``ARTM.get_theta`` method.
* removed ``ARTM.fit_transform`` method;
  note that the name was confusing because this method has never fitted the model;
  the purpose of ``ARTM.fit_transform`` was to retrieve Theta matrix after fitting the model (``ARTM.fit_offline`` or ``ARTM.fit_online``);
  same functionality is now available via ``ARTM.get_theta`` method.
* introduced ``ARTM.get_score`` method, which will exist in parallel to score tracking functionality;
  the goal for ``ARTM.get_score(score_name)`` is to always return the latest version of the score;
  for Phi scores this means to calculate them on fly;
  for Theta scores this means to return a score aggregated over last call to ``ARTM.fit_offline``, ``ARTM.fit_online`` or ``ARTM.transform`` methods;
  opposite to ``ARTM.get_score`` the score tracking functionality returns the overall history of a score.
  For further details on score calculation refer to `Q&A section <https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/wiki/Q&A#how-to-calculate-perplexity-on-held-out-sample>`_ in our wiki page.
* added ``data_weight`` in ``BatchVectorizer.__init__`` constructor to let user specify an individual weight for each batch
* score tracker classes had been rewritten, so you should make minor changes in the code that retrieves scores; for example:
* added an API to initialize logging with custom logging directory, log level, etc...
