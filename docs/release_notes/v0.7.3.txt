BigARTM v0.7.3 Release notes
============================

BigARTM v0.7.3 releases the following changes:

* New command line tool for BigARTM
* Support for classification in bigartm CLI
* Support for asynchronous processing of batches
* Improvements in coherence regularizer and coherence score
* New *TopicMass* score for phi matrix
* Support for documents markup
* New API for importing batches through memory


New command line tool for BigARTM
---------------------------------

New CLI is named ``bigartm`` (or ``bigrtm.exe`` on Windows),
and it supersedes previous CLI named ``cpp_client``. 
New CLI has the following features:

* Parse collection in one of the :doc:`../tutorials/python_userguide/loading_data`
* Load dictionary
* Initialize a new model, or import previously created model
* Perform EM-iterations to fit the model
* Export predicted probabilities for all documents into CSV file
* Export model into a file

All command-line options are listed `here <http://docs.bigartm.org/en/latest/tutorials/bigartm_cli.html>`_,
and you may see several exampels on `BigARTM <http://github.com/bigartm/bigartm>`_ page at github.
At the moment full documentation is only available in `Russian <https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm-book/blob/master/junk/cli/BigARTM_CommandLineInferface.ipynb>`_.


Support for classification in BigARTM CLI
-----------------------------------------

BigARTM CLI is now able to perform classification.
The following example assumes that your batches have ``target_class`` modality in addition to the default modality (``@default_class``).

.. code-block:: bash

   # Fit model
   bigartm.exe --use-batches <your batches>
               --use-modality @default_class,target_class
               --topics 50
               --dictionary-min-df 10
               --dictionary-max-df 25%
               --save-model model.bin

   # Apply model and output to text files
   bigartm.exe --use-batches <your batches>
               --use-modality @default_class,target_class
               --topics 50
               --passes 0
               --load-model model.bin
               --predict-class target_class
               --write-predictions pred.txt
               --write-class-predictions pred_class.txt
               --csv-separator=tab
               --score ClassPrecision

Support for asynchronous processing of batches
----------------------------------------------

Asynchronous processing of batches enables applications to 
overlap EM-iterations better utilize CPU resources.
The following chart shows CPU utilization of ``bigartm.exe``
with (left-hand side) and without async flag (right-hand side).

TopicMass score for phi matrix
------------------------------

Topic mass score calculates cumulated topic mass for each topic.
This is a useful metric to monitor balance between topics.

Support for documents markup
------------------------------

Document markup provides topic distribution for each word in a document.
Since BigARTM v0.7.3 it is posible to extract this information to use it.
A potential application includes color-highlighted maps of the document,
where every work is colored according to the most probable topic of the document.

In the code this feature is refered to as ``ptdw`` matrix.
It is possible to extract and regularizer ``ptdw`` matrices.
In future versions it will be also possible to calculate scores based on ``ptdw`` matrix.

New API for importing batches through memory
--------------------------------------------

New low-level APIs ``ArtmImportBatches`` and ``ArtmDisposeBatches``
allow to import batches from memory into BigARTM.
Those batches are saved in BigARTM, and can be used for batches processing.
