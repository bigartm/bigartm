Installation for Linux and Mac OS-X users
=========================================

Currently there is no distribution package of BigARTM for Linux.
BigARTM had been tested on several Linux OS, and it is known to work well,
but you have to get the source code and compile it locally on your machine.

System dependencies
-------------------

Building BigARTM requires the following components:

    * `git <https://git-scm.org>`_ (any recent version) -- for obtaining source code;
    * `cmake <https://cmake.org>`_ (at least of version 2.8), *make*,
      *g++* or *clang* compiler with c++11 support,
      `boost <boost.org>`_ (at least of version 1.40) --
      for building library and binary executable;
    * `python <https://python.org>`_ (version 2.7) --
      for building Python API for BigARTM.

To simplify things, you may type:

* **On deb-based distributions**:
  ``sudo apt-get install git make cmake build-essential libboost-all-dev``

* **On rpm-based distributions**:
  ``sudo yum install git make cmake gcc-c++ glibc-static libstdc++-static boost boost-static python``
  (for Fedora 22 or higher use ``dnf`` instead of ``yum``) 

* **On Mac OS distributions**:
  ``sudo brew install git cmake boost``


Download sources and build
--------------------------

Clone the latest BigARTM code from our github repository,
and build it via CMake as in the following script.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~
   git clone --branch=stable https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm.git
   cd bigartm
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make

**Note for Linux users:** By default building
binary executable ``bigartm`` requiers static versions of Boost, C and C++ libraries.
To alter it, run ``cmake`` command with option ``-DBUILD_STATIC_BIGARTM=OFF``.


System-wide installation
------------------------

To install command-line utility, shared library module and Python interface for BigARTM,
you can type:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo make install

Normally this will install:

- ``bigartm`` utility into folder ``/usr/local/bin/``;
- shared library ``libartm.so`` (``artm.dylib`` for Max OS-X)
  into folder ``/usr/local/lib/``;
- Python interface for BigARTM into Python-specific system directories, along
  with necessary dependencies.

If you want to alter target folders for binary and shared library objects,
you may specify common prefix while running ``cmake`` command
via option ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path_to_folder``.
By default ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/``.


Configure BigARTM Python API
----------------------------

If you want to use only Python interface for BigARTM, you may run following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Step 1 - install Google Protobuf as dependency
   cd ~/bigartm/3rdparty/protobuf/python
   sudo python setup.py install

   # Step 2 - install Python interface for BigARTM
   cd ~/bigartm/python
   sudo python setup.py install

   # Step 3 - point ARTM_SHARED_LIBRARY variable to libartm.so (libartm.dylib) location
   export ARTM_SHARED_LIBRARY=~/bigartm/build/src/artm/libartm.so        # for linux
   export ARTM_SHARED_LIBRARY=~/bigartm/build/src/artm/libartm.dylib     # for Mac OS X

We strongly recommend system-wide installation as
there is no need to keep BigARTM code after it, so you may safely
remove folder ``~bigartm/``.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you build BigARTM in existing folder ``build`` (e.g. you built BigARTM before) and encounter any errors,
it may be due to out-of-date file ``CMakeCache.txt`` in folder ``build``. In that case we strongly recommend
to delete this file and try to build again.

----------------

While building BigARTM you can see lines similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    Building python package protobuf 2.5.1-pre
      File "/home/ubuntu/bigartm/3rdparty/protobuf/python/setup.py", line 52
        print "Generating %s..." % output
                                 ^
    SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'

This error may happen during google protobuf installation.
It indicates that you are using ``Python 3``, which is not supported by BigARTM.
(see `this <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/826948/syntax-error-on-print-with-python-3>`_ 
question on StackOverflow for more details on the error around `print`).
Please use ``Python 2.7`` (e.g ``Python 2.7.11``) to workaround this issue.

----------------

Using BigARTM Python API you can encounter this error:

.. code-block:: bash

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/artm/wrapper/api.py", line 19, in __init__
    File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/artm/wrapper/api.py", line 53, in _load_cdll
    OSError: libartm.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
    Failed to load artm shared library. Try to add the location of `libartm.so` file into your LD_LIBRARY_PATH system variable, or to set ARTM_SHARED_LIBRARY - a specific system variable which may point to `libartm.so` file, including the full path. 
 
This error indicates that BigARTM's python interface can not locate libartm.so (libartm.dylib) files.
In such case type ``export ARTM_SHARED_LIBRARY=path_to_artm_shared_library``.

BigARTM on Travis-CI
--------------------

To get a live usage example of BigARTM you may check BigARTM's
`.travis.yml <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigartm/bigartm/master/.travis.yml>`_
script and the latest `continuous integration build
<https://travis-ci.org/bigartm/bigartm>`_.
