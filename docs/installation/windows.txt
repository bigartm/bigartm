Installation for Windows users
==============================

Download
--------

Download latest binary distribution of BigARTM from https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/releases.
Explicit download links can be found at :doc:`/download` section (for 32 bit and 64 bit configurations).

The distribution will contain pre-build binaries, command-line interface and BigARTM API for Python.
The distribution also contains a simple dataset.
More datasets in BigARTM-compatible format are available in the :doc:`/download` section.

Refer to :doc:`/ref/windows_distribution` for details about other files, included in the binary distribution package.

Configure BigARTM Python API
----------------------------

1.  Install Python, for example from the following links:

    * Python 2.7.11, 64 bit --  https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.11/python-2.7.11.amd64.msi, or
    * Python 2.7.11, 32 bit -- https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.11/python-2.7.11.msi

    Remember that the version of BigARTM package must match your version Python installed on your machine.
    If you have 32 bit operating system then you must select 32 bit for Python and BigARTM package.
    If you have 64 bit operating system then you are free to select either version.
    However, please note that memory usage of 32 bit processes is limited by 2 GB.
    For this reason we recommend to select 64 bit configurations.

    Please note that you must use ``Python 2.7``, because ``Python 3`` is not
    supported by BigARTM.
	
    Also you need to have several Python libraries to be installed on your machine:
	
    * numpy >= 1.9.2
    * pandas >= 0.16.2


2.  Add ``C:\BigARTM\bin`` folder to your ``PATH`` system variable, and
    add ``C:\BigARTM\python`` to your ``PYTHONPATH`` system variable:

    .. code-block:: bash
  
       set PATH=%PATH%;C:\BigARTM\bin
       set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts
       set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\BigARTM\Python

    Remember to change ``C:\BigARTM`` and ``C:\Python27`` with your local folders.

3.  Setup *Google Protocol Buffers* library, included in the BigARTM release package.

    * Copy ``C:\BigARTM\bin\protoc.exe`` file into ``C:\BigARTM\protobuf\src`` folder
    * Run the following commands from command prompt
    
    .. code-block:: bash
  
        cd C:\BigARTM\protobuf\Python
        python setup.py build
        python setup.py install

    Avoid ``python setup.py test`` step, as it produces several confusing errors. Those errors are harmless.
    For further details about protobuf installation refer to `protobuf/python/README
    <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigartm/bigartm/master/3rdparty/protobuf/python/README.txt>`_.

.. If you are getting errors when configuring or using Python API,
   please refer to Troubleshooting chapter in :doc:`/installation/linux`.
   The list of issues is common between Windows and Linux.
