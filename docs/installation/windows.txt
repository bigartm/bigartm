Installation for Windows users
==============================

Download
--------

Download latest binary distribution of BigARTM from https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/releases.
Explicit download links can be found at :doc:`/download` section (64 bit only).

The distribution will contain pre-build binaries, command-line interface and BigARTM API for Python.
The distribution also contains a simple dataset.
More datasets in BigARTM-compatible format are available in the :doc:`/download` section.

You may also try BigARTM from pre-built docker container, as described in :doc:`docker`.

Use BigARTM from command line
-----------------------------

Download the latest package from https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/releases.
Unpack it to ``C:\BigARTM``.
Open command line or power shell and change working directory to ``C:\BigARTM\bin``.
Now you may use BigARTM command line utility ``bigartm.exe``.
Go to :doc:`/tutorials/bigartm_cli` for examples and further directions.

Configure BigARTM Python API
----------------------------

1.  Install Python, for example from Anaconda distribution (https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
    You are free to choose ``Python 2.7`` or ``Python 3``, both are supported with BigARTM.
    You have to choose 64 bit Python installation.

2.  Install Python packages that BigARTM depend on.

    * ``numpy >= 1.9.2`` (skip this if you install via Anaconda)
    * ``pandas >= 0.16.2`` (skip this if you install via Anaconda)
    * ``protobuf >= 3.0.0`` (not included in Anaconda; install by running ``pip install protobuf==3.0.0``)
    * ``tqdm`` (not included in Anaconda; install by running ``pip install tqdm``)

3.  Add ``C:\BigARTM\bin`` folder to your ``PATH`` system variable, and
    add ``C:\BigARTM\python`` to your ``PYTHONPATH`` system variable:

    .. code-block:: bash
  
       set PATH=%PATH%;C:\BigARTM\bin
       set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\BigARTM\Python

    Remember to change ``C:\BigARTM`` if you unpack to another location.

4. Now you can used BigARTM from Python shell or from ipython notebook.
   Refer to :doc:`/tutorials/python_tutorial` or :doc:`/tutorials/python_userguide/index`  for examples,
   or to :doc:`/api_references/python_interface` for documentation.

If you are getting errors when configuring or using Python API,
please refer to Troubleshooting chapter in :doc:`/installation/linux`.
The list of issues is common between Windows and Linux.
Normally you should install protobuf for python with ``pip install``.
An alternative way is to install it from the package that comes with BigARTM.
This is described `here <https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/wiki/Q&A#how-to-install-python-protobuf-from-bigartm-package-on-windows>`_.
