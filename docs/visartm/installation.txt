Installation
====================

You can deploy VisARTM locally on your computer. It supports any OS: Windows, Linux or MacOS. Please follow next steps.

1. Make sure you have installed python 3. We recommend use `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_. 

2. Make sure you have installed `BigARTM <http://bigartm.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation/index.html>`_.

3. Install `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/download/>`_ and `pgAdmin <https://www.pgadmin.org/>`_. Of cource, ou can use any database management system with django, but we recommend PostgreSQL.

4. Open pgAdmin and create new database. Please remember username and password to this database. Default username in PostgreSQL is "postgres".

5. Make sure you have installed git.

6. Clone  VisARTM with console command

.. code-block:: bash 

   git clone https://github.com/bigartm/visartm.git

7. Install all required dependencies, including django:

.. code-block:: bash 

   cd visartm
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
8. Now link database created in step 4 with VisARTM. For that, open file **visartm/settings.py** and lines like these:

.. code-block:: python 

   DATABASES = {
		'default': {
			'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
			'NAME': 'artmonlinedb',
			'USER': 'postgres',
			'PASSWORD': '******',
			'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
			'PORT': '5432', 
		}
	}

Modify values as follows. NAME is name of database. USER is name of user of database. PASSWORD is his password. If you use local PostgreSQL, you will not need change ENGINE, otherwise it's up to you. You are running database server locally, so don't modify HOST value. 

9. Now you need django to create tables. For that, go to folder named **visartm** and run:

.. code-block:: bash 

   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   
10. Create superuser for the service. Django will ask you for username and passwrod. Please remember them, you will need them to use service.

.. code-block:: bash 

   python manage.py createsuperuser
   
11. Run the server.

.. code-block:: bash 

   python manage.py runserver
   
12. Open your favorite web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000
