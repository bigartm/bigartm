Installation
====================

You can deploy VisARTM locally on your computer. It supports any OS: Windows, Linux or MacOS. Please follow next steps.

1. Make sure you have installed python 3. We recommend use `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_. 

2. Make sure you have installed `BigARTM <http://bigartm.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation/index.html>`_.

3. Make sure you have installed git.

4. Clone  VisARTM with console command

.. code-block:: bash 

   git clone https://github.com/bigartm/visartm.git

5. Install all required dependencies, including django:

.. code-block:: bash 

   cd visartm
   pip install -r requirements.txt
 
6. Now you need django to create tables.

.. code-block:: bash 

   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   
Note: repeat this lines later after each time you make **git pull**.
   
7. Create superuser for the service. Django will ask you for username and passwrod. Please remember them, you will need them to use service.

.. code-block:: bash 

   python manage.py createsuperuser
   
8. Run the server.

.. code-block:: bash 

   python manage.py runserver 

   
9. Open web browser (Google Chrome is recommended) and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000
   
Congratulations! You have installed BigRTM and it works! But you have to do some additional steps. By default, VisARTM uses **sqlite** database and it is not good for really big data sets. So, we recommend you install PostgreSQL databse management system. 
   
10. Install `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/download/>`_ and `pgAdmin <https://www.pgadmin.org/>`_. Of cource, ou can use any database management system with django, but we recommend PostgreSQL.

11. Open pgAdmin and create new database. Please remember username and password to this database. Default username in PostgreSQL is "postgres".
    
12. Now link database created in step 11 with VisARTM. For that, open file **visartm/settings.py** and  find lines:

.. code-block:: python 

	DATABASES = {
		'default': {
			'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
			'NAME': 'visartm.sqlite',
		}
	}
	
Replace them with:	

.. code-block:: python 

   DATABASES = {
		'default': {
			'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
			'NAME': 'databasename',
			'USER': 'postgres',
			'PASSWORD': 'XXXXXX',
			'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
			'PORT': '5432', 
		}
	}
	
Here **databasename** is the name of your database, **XXXXXX** is the password.
	
13. Repeat steps 6-7.
