Model creation
====================

Automatic model creation
----------------------------------
For quick start, use built-in model builder.

Go to **Datasets**, select dataset, click **Create new model**. Select tab **Flat** or **Hierarchial**, choose number of topcs and iterations and click **Create**.

Creating model with script
-----------------------------------
Go to **Datasets**, select dataset, click **Create new model**. Select tab **Empty** and click **Create**.

VisARTM will create a folder and shows you full path to that folder. There you will find sample script named **sample.py**. 
This script will tell you, how initialize ARTM model with dataset, and where to put result.

For a flat model, result is two matrices **theta** and **phi**. You should save them to folder of model, using **to_pickle()** methd
of **pandas.DataFrame**.

When matrices are ready, just press **Reload** on page of model. 

Hierarchical models
-----------------------------------
If you are building N-tier hierarchy using hARTM, it is necessary to save also files **psi1**, **psi2**, ..., **psi(N-1)**. Save them also using
**to_pickle()**, next to **theta** and **phi**.

Multiple models
-----------------------------------
You can create another model. Just go to dataset page and click **Create new model**. You can delete model from page of models, or delete all models, using option **Clear** on dataset page. List of all models is available on the right of dataset page.
