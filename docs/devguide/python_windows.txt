Python code on Windows
======================

* Install Python 2.7 (this step is already done if you are following the instructions above),

* Add Python to the ``PATH`` environmental variable

  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6318156/adding-python-path-on-windows-7

* Follow the instructions in ``README`` file in directory ``$(BIGARTM_ROOT)/3rdparty/protobuf/python/``.
  In brief, this instructions ask you to run the following commands:

  .. code-block:: bash

     python setup.py build
     python setup.py test
     python setup.py install

  On second step you fill see two failing tests:

  .. code-block:: bash

     Ran 216 tests in 1.252s
     FAILED (failures=2)

  This 2 failures are OK to ignore.

At this point you should be able to run BigARTM tests for Python, located under ``$(BIGARTM_ROOT)/python/tests/``.

* [Optional] Download and add to MSVS Python Tools 2.0.
  All necessary instructions can be found at https://pytools.codeplex.com/.
  This will allow you debug you Python scripts using Visual Studio.
  You may start with the following solution: ``$(BIGARTM_ROOT)/src/artm_vs2012.sln``.
