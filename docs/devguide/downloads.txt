* (optional) If you plan to build documentation, download and install sphinx-doc as described here: http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/index.html
* (optional) 7-zip -- http://www.7-zip.org/a/7z920-x64.msi
* (optional) Putty -- http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe

All explicit links are given just for convenience if you are setting up new environment.
You are free to choose other versions or tools, and most likely they will work just fine for BigARTM.
Remember to match the following:
* Visual Studio version must match Boost binaries version, unless you build Boost yourself
* Use the same configuration (32 bit or 64 bit) for your Python and BigARTM binaries
