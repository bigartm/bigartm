Build C++ code on Linux
=======================

Refer to :doc:`/installation/linux`.


System dependencies
-------------------

Building BigARTM requires the following components:

    * `git <https://git-scm.org>`_ (any recent version) -- for obtaining source code;
    * `cmake <https://cmake.org>`_ (at least of version 2.8), *make*,
      *g++* or *clang* compiler with c++11 support,
      `boost <boost.org>`_ (at least of version 1.40) --
      for building library and binary executable;
    * `python <https://python.org>`_ (version 2.7 or 3.4) --
      for building Python API for BigARTM.


Building C++ code with CMake
----------------------------

BigARTM is hosted at github repository, with two branches --- ``stable`` and ``master``.
``stable`` contains latest stable release, while ``master`` is the latest version of the code.
Normally ``master`` is also quite stable, so do not hesitate to try this branch.

Build is built  via CMake, as in the following script.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~
   git clone --branch=stable https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm.git
   cd bigartm
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make

**Note for Linux users:** By default building
binary executable ``bigartm`` requiers static versions of Boost, C and C++ libraries.
To alter it, run ``cmake`` command with option ``-DBUILD_BIGARTM_CLI_STATIC=OFF``.


System-wide installation
------------------------

To install command-line utility, shared library module and Python interface for BigARTM,
you can type:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo make install

Normally this will install:

- ``bigartm`` utility into folder ``/usr/local/bin/``;
- shared library ``libartm.so`` (``artm.dylib`` for Max OS-X)
  into folder ``/usr/local/lib/``;
- Python interface for BigARTM into Python-specific system directories, along
  with necessary dependencies.

If you want to alter target folders for binary and shared library objects,
you may specify common prefix while running ``cmake`` command
via option ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path_to_folder``.
By default ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/``.


Configure BigARTM Python API
----------------------------

Python's interface of BigARTM is normally configured by running ``make install``.
As an alternative you may configure it manually as described below, however you still need to build native code of BigARTM with ``make``.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Step 1 - install Google Protobuf as dependency
   # (this can be replaced by "pip install protobuf")
   cd ~/bigartm/3rdparty/protobuf/python
   sudo python setup.py install

   # Step 2 - install Python interface for BigARTM
   cd ~/bigartm/python
   sudo python setup.py install

   # Step 3 - point ARTM_SHARED_LIBRARY variable to libartm.so (libartm.dylib) location
   export ARTM_SHARED_LIBRARY=~/bigartm/build/lib/libartm.so        # for linux
   export ARTM_SHARED_LIBRARY=~/bigartm/build/lib/libartm.dylib     # for Mac OS X

We strongly recommend system-wide installation (e.g. ``make install``) as
there is no need to keep BigARTM code after it, so you may safely
remove folder ``~/bigartm/``.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you build BigARTM in existing folder ``build`` (e.g. you built BigARTM before) and encounter any errors,
it may be due to out-of-date file ``CMakeCache.txt`` in folder ``build``. In that case we strongly recommend
to delete this file and try to build again.

----------------

Using BigARTM Python API you can encounter this error:

.. code-block:: bash

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/artm/wrapper/api.py", line 19, in __init__
    File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/artm/wrapper/api.py", line 53, in _load_cdll
    OSError: libartm.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
    Failed to load artm shared library. Try to add the location of `libartm.so` file into your LD_LIBRARY_PATH system variable, or to set ARTM_SHARED_LIBRARY - a specific system variable which may point to `libartm.so` file, including the full path. 
 
This error indicates that BigARTM's python interface can not locate libartm.so (libartm.dylib) files.
In such case type ``export ARTM_SHARED_LIBRARY=path_to_artm_shared_library``.

BigARTM on Travis-CI
--------------------

To get a live usage example of BigARTM you may check BigARTM's
`.travis.yml <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigartm/bigartm/master/.travis.yml>`_
script and the latest `continuous integration build
<https://travis-ci.org/bigartm/bigartm>`_.
