Working with iPython notebooks remotely
=======================================

It turned out to be common scenario to run BigARTM on a Linux server (for example on Amazon EC2), while connecting to it from Windows through ``putty``.
Here is a convenient way to use ``ipython notebook`` in this scenario:

1. Connect to the Linux machine via `putty <http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe>`_.
   Putty needs to be configured with dynamic tunnel for port ``8888`` as describe here on `this page <https://anapnea.net/tut_putty_tunneling.php>`_
   (port ``8888`` is a default port for ``ipython notebook``).
   The same page describes how to configure internet properties:
   
   *Clicking on Settings in Internet Explorer, or Proxy Settings in Google Chrome, should open this dialogue. Navigate through to the Advanced Proxy section and add localhost:9090 as a SOCKS Proxy.*

2. Start ``ipython notebook`` in your putty terminal.

3. Open your favourite browser on Windows, and go to http://localhost:8888. Enjoy your notebook while the engine runs on remotely :)
