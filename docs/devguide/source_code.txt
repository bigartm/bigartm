Source code
===========

BigARTM is hosted in public GitHub repository:

https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm

We maintain two branches: `master <https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/tree/master>`_ and `stable <https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/tree/stable>`_.
`master` branch is the latest source code, potentially including some unfinished features.
`stable` branch will be lagging behind `master`, and moved forward to `master` as soon as mainteiners decide that it is ready.
Typically this should happen at the end of each month.
At the same point we will introduce a new tag (something like `v0.7.3 <https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/tree/v0.7.3>`_ ) and produce a new release for Windows.
In addition, `stable` branch also might receive small urgent fixes in between releases,
typically to address critical issues reported by our users. Such fixes will be also included in `master` branch.

To contribute a fix you should `fork <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>`_ the repository,
code your fix and submit a `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_. against *master* branch.
All pull requests are regularly monitored by BigARTM maintainers and will be soon merged.
Please, keep monitoring the status of your pull request
`on travis <https://travis-ci.org/bigartm/bigartm/pull_requests>`_,
which is a continuous integration system used by BigARTM project.
